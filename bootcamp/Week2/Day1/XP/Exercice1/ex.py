#Exercise 2 : Some Math
#Instructions
#Write code that calculates the result of: (99^3)*8 (meaning 99 to the power of 3, times 8).

number = 99
power = 3
multiplier = 8

result = number ** power * multiplier

print(result)


#Exercise 3 : What Is The Output ?
#Instructions
#Predict the output of the following code snippets:
#>>> 5 < 3
#>>> 3 == 3
#>>> 3 == "3"
#>>> "3" > 3
#>>> "Hello" == "hello"
5 < 3

Output: False
3 == 3

Output: True
3 == "3"

Output: False
"3" > 3

Output: TypeError (unsupported operand type(s) for >: 'str' and 'int')
"Hello" == "hello"

Output: False

#Run your code
name = "John"
age = 25
shoe_size = 9
info = "My name is " + name + ". I am " + str(age) + " years old and my shoe size is " + str(shoe_size) + "."

print(info)


#ðŸŒŸ Exercise 6 : A & B
#Instructions
#Create two variables, a and b.

b = 5
if a > b:
    print("Hello World")

#Exercise 7 : Odd Or Even
