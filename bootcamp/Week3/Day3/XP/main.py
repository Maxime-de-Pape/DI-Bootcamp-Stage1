# Exercise 1 : Built-In Functions
# Instructions
# Python has many built-in functions.
# If you feel that you donâ€™t know how to properly implement them take a look at the python documentation online.
#
# Write a program which prints the results of the following python built-in functions: abs(), int(), input().
# Using the __doc__ dunder method create your own documentation which explains the execution of your code. Take a look at the doc method on google for help.
#
#

def print_builtin_functions():
     The program prints: abs(), int(), and input(). It then prints the results of each function
    # get abs() function of -10
    number = -10
    absolute_value = abs(number)
    print("The absolte value of -10 is :" abs_value)

 # Convert the string "123" to an integer.
  integer = int("123")
  print("The ineteger value of '123' is:", integer)

    # get input() function
    user_input = input("Enter your number: ")
    print("You entered:", user_input)


if __name__ == "__main__":
  print_results()




# ðŸŒŸ Exercise 2: Currencies
# Instructions
# class Currency:
#     def __init__(self, currency, amount):
#         self.currency = currency
#         self.amount = amount
#
    Your code starts HERE
#
#
# Using the code above, implement the relevant methods and dunder methods which will output the results below.
# Hint : When adding 2 currencies which donâ€™t share the same label you should raise an error.
# >>> c1 = Currency('dollar', 5)
# >>> c2 = Currency('dollar', 10)
# >>> c3 = Currency('shekel', 1)
# >>> c4 = Currency('shekel', 10)
#
# >>> str(c1)
# '5 dollars'
#
# >>> int(c1)
# 5
#
# >>> repr(c1)
# '5 dollars'
#
# >>> c1 + 5

# 10 dollars

# >>> c1 += c2
# >>> c1
# 20 dollars
